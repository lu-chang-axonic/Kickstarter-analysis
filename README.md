## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
As Excel was a subject that I am very comfortable with, I was going to jump onto the challenge directly based on my past knowledge. This did not work well as the assignment was given in conjunction with the class material, which we didn't go through in the class. It took me awhile to realize that I was supposed to download the data file from the module on the bootcamspot.com. This took me more than one hour to figure out.

Another bump in the road was When I worked on the second deliverable. Even though this is an excel task that is very easy for me, I made a mistake not to include "=" in my formulas, so that the cases that fall on the upper and lower limit of the ranges of "goal" was accidentally dropped. I had to use filters on the data sheet to investigate why my total number of cases were lower than what it should be. This process took me 30-60 mins. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. It is more likely for a project to succeed if it is launched warmer months, with the success rate peaking in May.
2. Cancelation rate is usually pretty low and was not noticeably impacted by seasonality.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
When the goal dollar amount is lower, especially less than $5000, the successful rate is very high. 
When the goal dollar amount is higher, especially greater than $45,000, the successful rate is very low. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The dataset is overly simplistic for the purpose of understanding what makes a project successful. There is a lack of other relevant variables. Other than the date the project is launched or the goal it has, there many other factors that could impact its outcome, such as the experience of the proposer in similar projects, cast, runtime, the genre, quality of the script, etc.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could attempt to analyze the impact of the deadline, location (country), spot light, etc. Basically, we can go through each variable provided, chart it to see if there is any trend that can be identified. Then, proving it by a regression analysis to see which one truly had a significant impact.
