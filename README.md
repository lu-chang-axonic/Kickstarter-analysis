# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
As Excel was a subject that I am very comfortable with, I was going to jump onto the challenge directly based on my past knowledge. This did not work well as the assignment was given in conjunction with the class material, which we didn't go through in the class. It took me awhile to realize that I was supposed to download the data file from the module on the bootcamspot.com. This took me more than one hour to figure out.

Another bump in the road was When I worked on the second deliverable. Eventhough this is an excel task that is very easy for me, I made a mistake not to include "=" in my formulas, so that the cases that fall on the upper and lower limit of the ranages of "goal" was accidentally dropped. I had to use filters on the data sheet to investigate why my total number of cases were lower than what it should be. This process took me 30-60 mins. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
